### Generate inventory and vars.yml with jinja 
For the nginx/cleanup playbook to run, ansible needs the inventory.yml and vars.yml file. These are generated by ansible.py rendering the jinja from templates in `templates/`. 
```
python ansible.py 
// reads templates/*, generates inventory.yml and vars.yml in this directory
ansible-playbook nginx.yml
```
